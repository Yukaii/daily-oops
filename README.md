## About

This is the source code of my blog [Daily Oops](https://yukai.dev), which is built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and uses HackMD as a CMS(Content Management System).

You can read the details of how it actually works [here](https://yukai.dev/blog/2021/05/16/hackmd-as-cms-blog-feat-next-js) (in Chinese).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
